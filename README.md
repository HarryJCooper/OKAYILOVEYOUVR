# OKAYILOVEYOU VR and Music

This is the code base for the OKAYILOVEYOU Music and VR site. Created using ThreeJS, React and Tailwind, ignoring the existence of React Three Fibre for educational purposes.

## OKAYILOVEYOU are:
Connor: Bass and The Funk \
Curt: Guitar and a Powerful Sense of Dread \
Harry: Drums and Delay Pedals
